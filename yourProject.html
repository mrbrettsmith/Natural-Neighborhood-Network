                            Your garden is a great way to get to know your neighborhood. The care and effort you put into gardening not only beautifies the street, it helps keep the city healthy. An intentional garden supports nature while letting you make an eye-catching statement because when your garden gets attention it also helps spread awareness about sustainable gardening practices. The Natural Neighborhood Network was created to help you make your mark.

                            Even a tiny space can have a big impact. A small garden made with care can support pollinators, clean the water, and be the foundation that other flora and fauna need to thrive. The Natural Neighborhood Network has focused on some of the most impactful sustainable projects for Minneapolis: Rain Gardens, Native Prairie Wildflowers, Pollinator Habitats, and Urban Tree Coverage. Each of these themes is designed to restore native plants which helps the immediate area, as well as the entire region, be healthy and resistant to weather events.

                            Gardening is fun, and brings life to your street. A beautiful yard brings joy and sparks curiosity for your neighbors. It also helps spread awareness of the good impact a garden has on the community and inspires others to start projects of their own. The Natural Neighborhood Network’s mission is to help connect individual gardeners to others in their neighborhood.

                            By adding signage to your garden it makes our community's efforts visible. Linking projects in the area is a celebration of the care and creativity of neighbors working together. A sustainable project may seem small on its own, but when it is grouped with others it does more than inspire, it provides a vital network of rest-stops for animals and plants. It mitigates wastewater and cools the urban environment. Of course, it also makes your neighborhood look beautiful!

                            The Natural Neighborhood Network is for everyone in our city. The more neighbors who participate the bigger the impact we will have. Gardening is great exercise and stress relief, and a vibrant property is great at getting smiles. Homeowners can bring interest to their property and express their personality. Renters can use garden beds, window boxes, and boulevards to get engaged. The Natural Neighborhood Network’s partners have tips for approaching a landlord or community living area with a sustainable garden proposal: often the conversations lead others joining in to help the project!
